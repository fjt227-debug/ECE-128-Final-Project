# ECE-128-Final-Project
The objective of this project is to design and implement a 4 bit calculator on the FPGA board that supports eight operations. These operations include arithmetic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and logical functions (AND, OR, XOR, and NOT). The system is developed using a modular hierarchy in Verilog, with separate modules for calculator logic (ALU), a BCD converter, and a Seven Segment display to enable real time output. A top level module integrates all submodules into a single functional design. A testbench is created to simulate and verify all calculator operations as well as the corresponding Seven Segment display outputs. Finally, the completed design is validated through hardware testing by demonstrating a fully functional calculator operating on the FPGA board. 1) Copy files to Vivado project and input into Design Sources 2) Copy testbench to Simulation Sources 3) Run sysnthesis and implementation 4) Generate bitstream 5) Program the FPGA board 6) Run the program
